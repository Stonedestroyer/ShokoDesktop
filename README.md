# Shoko Desktop
Repository for Shoko Desktop V2.

For development of Shoko Desktop, a client in development to replace the existing Shoko Desktop. Feel free to discuss 
this project on Discord with us by mentioning ClientV2 as that's what it's known as internally.

However we can't just create this new repo and leave you with nothing so here's a mockup of what we're planning Shoko Desktop
to look like. Please keep in mind we are still in the early development stages and things can and will change.
